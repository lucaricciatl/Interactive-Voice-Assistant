# Interactive Voice Assistant Using Text-to-Speech (TTS)

## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive voice assistant that uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to communicate with users. The assistant will listen to user inputs, process the requests, and respond using natural-sounding speech. This project can be a foundation for building personal assistants, customer support bots, or accessibility tools.

## Features

### Voice Input Recognition:
- Capture audio input from the user.
- Convert the audio input to text using Speech-to-Text (STT) technology.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Understand and process the text input to determine the user's intent.
- Use pre-trained models or services.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Output:
- Convert the processed response text back to speech.
- Use high-quality TTS engines to ensure natural-sounding output.

### Interactive Dialog Management:
- Maintain the context of conversations to allow multi-turn interactions.
- Handle interruptions and return to the previous context smoothly.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Provide a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the assistant.
- Support multiple platforms (e.g., web, mobile, desktop).

## Technology Stack

### Backend:
- Python for the core logic.
- Flask or FastAPI for the web server.
- Libraries for STT .
- Libraries for TTS (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS).

### Frontend:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the web interface.
- WebSocket for real-time communication.

### NLP:
- Pre-trained models from libraries such as spaCy, Hugging Face's Transformers.
- Integration with services like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Dialogflow for complex queries.
